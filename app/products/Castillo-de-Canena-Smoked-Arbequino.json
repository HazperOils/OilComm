  "description":"The latest creation from Castillo de Canena is their new Smoked Arbequino, a delicately smoked olive oil. Cold-infused with oak and other organic wood smoke, this oil maintains all of its essence and quality, preventing any alterations in the oilâ€™s natural properties without losing its flavor. This incredibly unique oil has a fresh aroma of apple and almond with a warm touch of caramel, vanilla and toffee. Try it on grilled sea bass, salmon, baked potatoes and soups to add just a touch of sweet smoky flavor." ,
