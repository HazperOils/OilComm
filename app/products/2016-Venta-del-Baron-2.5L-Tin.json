  "description":"Since 1998 Venta del Barón, included in the PDO Priego de Córdoba, has received more than 60 awards in 8 different countries, which include World´s Best Olive Oil by the International Olive Council as well as Spain’s Best Extra Virgin Olive Oil from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture. The PDO Priego de Córdoba is located in the very heart of Andalusia in the Sierras Subbéticas Natural Park. Due to its unique microclimate, the area produces internationally recognized olive oils of extraordinary quality. At the Muela olive mill in Priego de Córdoba, where the oil of Venta del Barón comes to life, the olives are cold pressed less than 15 hours after picking so that the genuine aroma of the olives is preserved, and only the best juice is selected according to the strict rules of the PDO Priego de Córdoba. The result is a luminous oil with intense fruity aromas of green herbs, peppermint, almond, banana and apple. Its flavor is reminiscent of vegetables such as tomatoes and artichoke, and has a slightly bitter and spicy finish." ,
