  "description":"Pressed from hand-picked olives mainly of the Olivastra Seggianese variety grown in the hills of Val dâ€™Orcia and Tuscan Maremma, this extra virgin olive oil is medium fruity with a clear scent of olives and notes of ripe fruit, banana, and a slight herbaceous scent of artichoke. Its taste is clean with a slightly sweet flavor, followed by a harmonious, slightly bitter and spicy finish. Ideal for drizzling on salads, bruschetta, and fish, and for preparing mayonnaise and other dressings." ,
