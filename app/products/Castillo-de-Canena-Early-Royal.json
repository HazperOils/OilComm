  "name":"Castillo de Canena Early Royal",
  "description":"Royal is a unique varietal native to the Cazorla Mountains of Jaen in Southern Spain whose cultivation goes back hundreds of years. Because the Royal olives and tree are very delicate, it requires the olives to be collected by hand. Its flavor is elegant with soft fruit, yet balanced and round, showing a slight touch of bitterness on the palate with harmonious notes of sweet green banana, almond and artichoke. Royal has a unique taste and versatility making it a favorite of gourmet chefs." ,
